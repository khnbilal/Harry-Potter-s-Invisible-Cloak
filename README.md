# Harry-Potter-s-Invisible-Cloak
The objective of this Python project is to create an invisible cloak using an image processing technique called colour detection and segmentation. For this project, youâ€™ll need a single-colour cloth. The cloth should not contain any other colour visible. Here, we are using a green cloth to develop this python project.
